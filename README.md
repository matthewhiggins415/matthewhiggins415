## About me: 
 🏅  Goals for 2022: <br />
      1. Get a job doing what I enjoy in software development ✅ <br />
      2. Create a deploy my own [ecomm site](https://www.thesimplecat.com/){:target="_blank"} ✅ <br />
      3. Create and deploy a fullstack platform to teach others on how to create fullstack, deployed sites <br />
      <br />
  🏄🏼‍♂️  Favorite hobby is surfing 

Just built that ecomm site with stripe integration. Currently, building a e-learning site that will use stripe subscriptions. Hoping to make another project that will use Plaid to analyze my personal spending in a really interactive way.
